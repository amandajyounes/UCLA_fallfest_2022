# UCLA 2022 Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon
## Overview
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for UCLA hosted by our Quantum Computing Student Association ([QCSA](https://qcsa.cqse.ucla.edu/)). The event is organized by our leadership team as part of the [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) and supported by IBM Quantum.

Our hackathon will run from Oct 31, 2022 to Sept 9, 2022, and we're welcoming students and teams from both UCLA and UC Berkeley in collaboration with UC Berkeley's undergraduate quantum computing group, [QCB](https://qcb.berkeley.edu/). No experience with quantum programming is necessary, and participating is a great way to learn about Qiskit and meet others interested in quantum computing!

All hackathon information will be posted here.

Please direct any logistical questions to our club email, quantum.ucla@gmail.com

## Registration
- This is a hackathon for UCLA and UC Berkeley students only
- Signups are now closed and groups have been sent out

## Details
