# UCLA 2022 Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon
## Overview
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for UCLA hosted by our Quantum Computing Student Association ([QCSA](https://qcsa.cqse.ucla.edu/)). The event is organized by our leadership team as part of the [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) and supported by IBM Quantum.

Our hackathon will run from Oct 31, 2022 to Sept 9, 2022, and we're welcoming students and teams from both UCLA and UC Berkeley in collaboration with UC Berkeley's undergraduate quantum computing group, [QCB](https://qcb.berkeley.edu/). No experience with quantum programming is necessary, and participating is a great way to learn about Qiskit and meet others interested in quantum computing!

All hackathon information will be posted here. We'll post more details in the next few weeks and we'll announce project and submission instructions [here](https://github.com/amandajyounes/UCLA_fallfest_2022/blob/main/project_submissions_guidelines.md) on the competition start date.

Please direct any logistical questions to our club email, quantum.ucla@gmail.com

--------------------------------
## Registration
- This is a hackathon for UCLA and UC Berkeley students only
- To sign up, register using [this form](https://forms.gle/fJFv116oVi8bctWe7). You will be able to form your own group of up to 5 students or be placed in a group

## Details
- All projects must use Qiskit, the open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules. You can learn more about Qiskit and begin getting familiar [here](https://qiskit.org/learn/)
- We will announce a submission format, project guidelines, and project suggestions at the start of the hackathon on Oct 31
- You cannot start your project before the start date on Oct 31, and you must submit by the deadline of Nov 8 at 11:59 PM
- The Berkeley group will be running an intro to Qiskit workshop, scheduled for the week of Oct 24. This is a good way to get started with Qiskit prior to the hackathon, and we recommend attending if possible.
- We will have a kickoff talk on the start date by Kevin Roche from IBM Research Almaden, who will be talking about building a quantum ecosystem as well as giving an overview of opportunities at IBM Research.
