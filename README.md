# Linear Regression with Quantum vs Classic
## Team BruWINS: Chaitanya Bashyam, Sivaji Turimella, Arnav Garg, Nishant Jain

**Problem Description:** Coming with a background of CS, Stats and Physics, we wanted to find a problem that worked with all of our strengths. We wanted to create a linear regression model with Quantum Computing and Classical Computing to compare performances. We built a Simple Linear Regression model predicting Son's height from their Father's height (Dataset: Freedman D, Pisani R, Purves R. (2007). Statistics (4th edition). Norton.).

**Strengths/Accomplishments:**

 - able to create a simple linear regression model analytically 
   + employed a quasi gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss function

**Challenges/Future Abilities:**

 - loss function is still very high - not able to get to zero
 - not able to do multiple regression
